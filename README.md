### Challenge

Your task is to generate an HTML page that lists the characters from a
Marvel-story.

Using the Marvel API [http://developer.marvel.com/docs], pick a random story
featuring your favorite character (perhaps The Hulk?). Generate an HTML page
with the following characteristics:

* The story's description
* A list of names and pictures of the characters that features in the story
* The Marvel attribution text

We are not too fuzzy about the layout or design of the generated HTML
page, but the HTML itself should be well-formatted.

Your solution should highlight your front-end abilities.
